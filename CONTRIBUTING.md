# GIT
- Make commits messages in english
- Create a new branch per issue


# Django urls
Use verbs like `create` or `add`, `list` and `update` and identify with the name of the resource. You can choose what ever you want but must be consistent in all urls.py files

```
example:

path(foo, name='add-payment')
path(foo, name='delete-payment')
path(foo, name='update-payment')
```
